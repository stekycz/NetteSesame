## Description

Client library for Sesame 2.x which utilises the REST API that it implements.

It requires **PHP >= 5.3.3** and **Nette Framework >= 2.0.0**.

## Usage

I am assuming at this point you have installed and configured Sesame, have a repository set up and the REST API functioning correctly.

**@todo:** Another usage notes will follow.
